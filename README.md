# Time-series-forecasting-using-Deep-Learning-Recurrent-LSTM-Neural-Nets
This repository contains parts of code developed for a capstone research project undertaken by me as part of master's degree at Purdue University. This is to understand the usefulness of LSTM RNN nueral network models in Time Series forecasting. As LSTMs are proven to perform well on sequential datasets, especially in NLP, it would be helpful to test their prediction capabilities on time series data with just the lag features.

The code shared under this repository is just to showcase the approach. The final working code was a proprietary of Llamasoft and could not be shared. This project work develops a good understanding of how Recurrent Nueral Network -LSTM's 'black-box' algorithm works.
